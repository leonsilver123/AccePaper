## Entry Points

Use these router skills first when the user goal spans several steps:

| Router | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `flows/rai-research-flow` | Field onboarding, knowledge-base mapping, literature bases, survey planning, ideation, and research coordination. |
| `flows/rai-paper-flow` | Robotics & AI conference paper evidence handoff, drafting, revision, response, and submission checks. |
| `flows/rai-coding-flow` | Research code implementation, debugging, testing, review, and reproducibility checks. |

Use atomic, reference, or tool skills directly when the user asks for one clear artifact, such as a search log, reading card, evidence matrix, survey synthesis, benchmark audit, provenance ledger, paper-code audit, figure plan, slide deck, citation audit, reviewer response, or submission check.

Each published skill must have a matching entry in `../catalog.json`.

The preferred skill shape is:

```text
skill-name/
|-- SKILL.md
|-- references/
|   `-- optional-reference.md
|-- scripts/
|   `-- optional-helper.py
`-- assets/
    `-- optional-template.ext
```

Do not add per-skill README files unless there is a strong reason. The skill itself should be the agent-facing entry point.
